  <p> <b> Rhea Ripley's</b>rein began at <b>WrestleMania 39</b>where she defeated the legendary <b>Charlotte Flair</b>winning the SmackDown Womens Championship. A few months later as Rhea was becoming the longest reining womens champion she was granted the privilege of being the first woman to hold the new womens championship belt over her head. Rhea was able to defeat each and every woman she stepped in the ring with including Natalya and Becky Lynch. Those are 2 of the most powerful women on the roster and Rhea defeated them.  </p>
