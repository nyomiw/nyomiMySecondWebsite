  <p> <b> Rhea Ripley's</b> rein began at <b>WrestleMania 39</b> where she defeated the legendary <b>Charlotte Flair</b> winning the SmackDown Womens Championship. A few months later as Rhea was becoming the longest reining womens champion she was granted the privilege of being the first woman to hold the new womens championship belt over her head. Rhea was able to defeat each and every woman she stepped in the ring with including Natalya and Becky Lynch. Those are 2 of the most powerful women on the roster and Rhea defeated them.  </p>
  <p>This awarding ceremony took place on <b>MONDAY NIGHT<i>ROLLINS</i></b> aka Monday Night Raw. Dominik Mysterio accomponied her to the ring being sure to open the ropes for her. As Adam Pierce granted her the belt she was going to make a special speech thanking Adam and the WWE Universe until she was interrupted. Rhea barely got a word out before someone decided they wanted to rain her parade and attempted to steal her shine. It was no one other than <b>Cody Rhodes</b> aka <b> the American Nightmare</b>. At the time Cody and Dom were fueding, and to get to Dom Cody Interrupted Rhea. </p>
  <p>During Rheas rein she gained the nick name <i>MAMI</i> along with <i>Rhea Bloody Ripley</i> and the most dominant woman on the WWE womens roster. As much as Damien Priest would hate to acknoledge it, Rhea <i>is</i> the leader of the Judgement Day. The fans know it, everyone knows it and theres no fighting it. Sadly Rhea had to relinquish her title due to an <i>injury</i> caused by the hater Liv Morgan. In reality Rhea was just too good and no one could beat her so she had to step down. In order for someone else to hold the title Rhea had to be injured because no one was able to beat her.</p>
